# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# place = Place.new(name: "home", address: "123 main st")
# place.save
# place = Place.new(name: "school", address: "111 school st")
# place.save
# place = Place.new(name: "park", address: "777 park pl")
# place.save
